It is an independent city-state located within Rome, Italy, and is home to the Pope and the central government of the Catholic Church.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the Vatican City is smaller than a golf course! Despite its tiny size, it has its own government, currency, postal system, and even its own police force. It's also home to numerous iconic landmarks like St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel.\n\nInterestingly, the Vatican City is not only the smallest country in the world but also the most densely populated, with a population of just over 800 people!",
